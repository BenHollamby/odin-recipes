    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> A hamburger (also burger for short) is a sandwich consisting of one or more cooked patties of ground meat, usually beef, placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. The patty may be pan fried, grilled, smoked or flame broiled. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chiles; condiments such as ketchup, mayonnaise, mustard, relish, or "special sauce"; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Â½ tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, peeled and finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 x 500g pack British Beef Steak Mince 15% fat</li>
        <li>1 tsp mixed dried herbs</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>4 slices mature Cheddar (optional)</li>
        <li>4 white rolls</li>
        <li>few round lettuce leaves, torn</li>
        <li>1 beef tomato, sliced</li>
        <li>ketchup, to serve (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the onion and cook for 5 minutes until softened and starting to turn golden. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine the beef mince with the herbs and the egg. Season, add the onions and mix well. Using your hands, shape into 4 patties.</li>
        <li>Cook the burgers on a preheated barbecue or griddle for 5-6 minutes on each side. While the second side is cooking, lay a slice of cheese on top to melt slightly (if using).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, lightly toast the cut-sides of the buns on the barbecue. Fill with the lettuce, burgers and tomato slices. Serve with ketchup, if you like.</li>
    </ol>
