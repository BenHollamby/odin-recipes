    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Mushroom Burger is a sandwich consisting of one or more cooked patties of ground meat, usually beef, placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. The patty may be pan fried, grilled, smoked or flame broiled. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chiles; condiments such as ketchup, mayonnaise, mustard, relish, or "special sauce"; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large flat mushrooms, stalks removed</li>
        <li>1 tbsp finely grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>4 tbsp light soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>1/2 lime, juice only</li>
        <li>1/2 Chinese cabbage, very finely shredded</li>
        <li>1 medium carrot, scrubbed and finely shredded or coarsely grated</li>
        <li>Â¼ cucumber, peeled and finely shredded, discarding core</li>
        <li>4 brioche burger buns, split open</li>
        <li>3 tbsp light mayonnaise</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the mushrooms in a shallow bowl in a single layer. Combine the grated ginger, soy and sesame oil in a separate bowl, mixing well, and spoon 3 tablespoons over the mushrooms, turning them to coat.</li>
        <li>Add the lime juice to the remaining ginger-soy mixture and toss with the shredded cabbage, carrot and cucumber.</li>
        <li>Make sure the coals on your barbecue are white hot with no trace of flame. Place the mushrooms directly onto the bars of the barbecue, gills-sides down. Cook for 3-4 minutes before turning over and cooking for a further 3 minutes. The mushrooms should be well-marked with griddle lines and tender. If they are colouring too quickly, move to a cooler part of the barbecue to cook more gently.</li>
        <li>Towards the end of the cooking time, place the cut sides of the brioche rolls on the barbecue bars and toast for a minute, until marked with griddle lines.</li>
        <li>Spread the lower bun halves with mayonnaise and top with a mushroom, gills-side up. Pile some slaw on top and finish with the bun top.</li>
    </ol>
