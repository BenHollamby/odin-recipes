    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Korean Burger is a sandwich consisting of one or more cooked patties of ground meat, usually beef, placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. The patty may be pan fried, grilled, smoked or flame broiled. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chiles; condiments such as ketchup, mayonnaise, mustard, relish, or "special sauce"; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.</p>

        <li>sweet potato wedges, to serve (optional)</li>
        <li>For the marinade:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp dark soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp toasted sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 spring onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2.5cm (1in) piece fresh ginger, peeled and chopped</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
            <li>1 tbsp honey</li>
            <li>1 tbsp dark brown sugar</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix together the marinade ingredients. Flatten out the chicken thighs and then add to the marinade, turning to coat. Cover and chill for 2 hours. Turn the meat after one hour and return to the fridge.</li>
        <li>Brush the bars of a preheated barbecue, or griddle, with oil. Cook the chicken over a medium-high heat for 12-15 minutes, turning once, until cooked through with no pink showing.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, put the rolls, cut side down, on the barbecue and lightly toast. Fill with the lettuce leaves and the cooked chicken, then top each with 1/2 a tsp of the ssamjang sauce and a scattering of the spring onion. Serve with freshly cooked sweet potato wedges, if you like.</li>
